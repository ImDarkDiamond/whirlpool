I go on all of these awesome meme accounts on instagram, and let me just tell you, pepe is the best. I strive to be pepe. And he, The Golden Peep, The Golden Pepe, uh, I just... I love it. I love... I LOVE BEING A MEME GIRL! Now, let me just tell you, relatable posts are the Best. Thing. Ever. They're the best. Let me tell you, I love 'em. Um, the ones that are like... 'that moment when you step on a crack and you-' that kind of stuff... OH MY GOSH, I live for those... just kidding. You normies disgust me. I hate pepe the frog, peep, whatever his name is. Peep, pee pee. Either way, he's stupid. And I don't really know why I made my face green to prove the point that I have pepe, but let me prove it by saying, "I hate you pepe." I hate you and your stupid meme and your stupid normie fanbase. You're all just dumb. I hate the golden pepe, I hate it all. I'm allergic to it. So, either you quit being a stupid darn old mee-mee, or meme, or whatever or else I'm gonna chop your head off your little- your little frogg head off like this... like that and you're going down under. With minions. Yeah, I said it."""}

    "pasta": """What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle, and without being involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, having over 300 confirmed kills and a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also Rick’s training in gorilla warfare which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces and I understand this stuff; I have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with talking shit about Rick and Morty over the Internet? Think again, fucker. People who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick’s existential catchphrase “Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and smirking just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon’s genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. Your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. How I pity you :joy: I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. And yes, by the way, I DO have a Rick & Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, nothin personnel kiddo :sunglasses: """}
    ,{"name":"Please Stop",
    "pasta":"""Despite being neutral myself, this drama or whatever, and so does the disrespecting, has to end peacefully. I can't stand by and watch both sides attack/conflict with each other for various reasons, I'm not being mean or anything, but violence/hostility truly doesn't solve anything. Besides, we the Humans are supposed to respect each other as an equal, regardless of whatever mistakes we commit. And that's how God expects all mortals alike to behave.In terms of simplification, Humans are supposed to be friendly towards each other as well as respect, not being hostile to one another. Although I don't want to say it, but I guess you have to apologise and forgive each other. There's no such thing as an unforgivable sin.Overall, nobody in the world is perfect, except for God himself. And that's the purpose of all mortals, make mistakes and learn from them. Sure, some of you may ask, some people aren't capable of learning from them, how are we supposed to trust them for that? Simple, sometimes mistakes can be difficult and slow to overcome, and this requires some infinite amount of patience. Every seed needs time to grow, not pluck the stems from the ground. Moral of the story is, we shouldn't disrespect each other of the same exact race as we are, there's always a better option rather than taking violence and hostility for an answer. """}
